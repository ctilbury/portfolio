# My Portfolio Website

Created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), originally as a Vue 3 app. Decided to switch back to Vue 2 to speed up development as I'm not up to speed on Vue 3 yet. Deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) at [ctilbury.co.uk](https://ctilbury.co.uk).

Uses Sass as a css pre-processor.

## Setup notes

To make Vite work with Vue 2, [vite-plugin-vue2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-vue2) and [vue-template-compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-template-compiler) are required. A full guide can be found [here](https://www.mathew-paul.nz/posts/how-to-use-vue2-with-vite/).

Node.js 16+ is required, and npm packages will need to be installed with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
